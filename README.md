# html-selling-pc-website
Website created as a challenge during Andrei Neagoie's web development course.

The website is just a reference for all of my computer parts that I'm selling prior to my move to Chicago in March of 2019.

The idea behind the website was to better learn HTML elements and to create something to better grasp what I was learning.
